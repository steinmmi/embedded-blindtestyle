# EmbeddedBlindtestyle

This project is an embedded version of _'Blindtestyle'_, a blindtest web game I am currently developping.

## Purpose

This project has a fun-purpose only. I won't use it in a commercial way.

The main goal of this project is to create a client/server within a raspberry PI to play a Blindtest game while at home or at a party.

A TV screen must be used :
- To show leaderborad
- Play desired music

While players uses their phones :
- To show leaderborad
- Ask for control (Answer by oral)

I can't guarantee that this project will be someday finished, neither can I guarantee I will document all of it

Feel free to use this code, but keep in mind that this is a personnal project that may not be easy to use for someone other than myself.


## Deployment

 1. Clone project : `git clone https://github.com/steinmmi/embedded-blindtestyle`
 2. In `client/src/assets`, Modify `config.json.scl` with server IP adress and rename it to `config.json`
